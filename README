# Durability and atomicity
## what is database 

- They can persist data to disk.
- They are disk-based, can work with larger-than-memory data.
- They are implemented from scratch, not as wrappers over other databases.

## Database has durability guarantee

## fsync system call

- DB will only return success to the client after fsync.
- If it fail before fsync or halfway, the most recent data may be lost, but it should not be half lost, half persisted
- A database must recover from a crash to a reasonable state, which is harder than using fsync.

# Data struct

- Hashtables
- Sorted Array
- B-tree

## page struct

```
// | key_size | val_size | key | val |
// |    2B    |    2B    | ... | ... |
// getters
// Here is our node format. The 2nd row is the encoded field size in bytes.

// | type | nkeys |  pointers  |  offsets   | key-values | unused |
// |  2B  |   2B  | nkeys × 8B | nkeys × 2B |     ...    |        |

```

## Two-phase update

### Atomicity + durability
