# Log-structured storage

Log-structured storage is a data storage technique that writes all changes sequentially to a log. This approach optimizes write performance and simplifies crash recovery by relying on the log as the source of truth. It is commonly used in modern databases and file systems to handle high-throughput workloads efficiently.

## Update by merge: amortize cost

### start with 2 files

- A small file holding the recent update and a large file holding the rest of the data

```mermaid
stateDiagram
    [*] --> Still
    Still --> [*]

    Still --> Moving
    Moving --> Still
    Moving --> Crash
    Crash --> [*]
```

# B-tree

## Height-balanced tree

## Generalizing binary trees

```mermaid
stateDiagram
    [1],[4],[9] --> [1,2,3,]
    [1],[4],[9] --> [4,5,9] 
    [1],[4],[9] --> [9,10,11]     
```

## Maintaining a B+tree

 - split node

```mermaid
stateDiagram
    [root] --> [L1]
    [root] --> [L2]
    [root] --> [L3]
```
