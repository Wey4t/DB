Record is split as key and values
And need to encode key and values
Every table has a prefix, it may help in ordering
so key is encoded as
```
                    4           8                                          8+len
         +-----------+-----------+-------------------------------------------+
         |   prefix  |    len    |             object serialization          |
         +-----------+-----------+-------------------------------------------+
```

It is problemtic because when compare key with bytes.Compare or memcmp it compare the len, result that the query is compare the length of key than compare the key

### Data Serialization

## Order-preserving encoding
